ENSE 374 Project
Group names: Michael, Justine, Cameron

# Project Explanation

This is project P.A.T. the Physical Activity Tracker made by Michael, Justine, Cameron as team Pulaski. The goal of this project is to provide a better web-based tool to track physical activities and assist people in reaching their goals with tracking, as well as finding things that others are doing with sharing and/or suggestions given to them by the application.

# Technologies used

HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, express, ejs, mongoDb, bootstrap

# MVP 1

The first Minimum Viable Product we have selected to make contains the most basic of
experiences we wish to provide to our users. It allows them to log into our tool so that each and
every log is kept personal and stored in the database rather than on the local device. The next
experience is our calendar functionality, where you can select any day in the past, present or
future and log or plan physical activities. This will allow for tracking of previous activities as
well as providing a clear idea for those who wish to plan ahead for what is coming next. The
final major experience in this MVP is the ability to view progress and set goals. This information
will be stored on the database and will allow users to not only set goals but see the progress they
have made in their journey to achieve their goals. Seeing this progress will help them keep
motivated to complete their goals and ultimately live the way that they set out to do.

# MVP 2

The second iteration of our tool takes away the need for sharing to a third party and
brings it right to the tool. It will bring full profiles where you can share activities, goals, personal
records and anything else you would like to keep yourself and your friends motivated. This is
seen as the second version as it is nice to have in our tool, however, to achieve core functionality
it is not required as sharing to a third-party app is seen as an absolute minimum. The experience
of being social on the app is seen as secondary as it supports the experience given in MVP one,
but it does not hinder those if it is not present.
